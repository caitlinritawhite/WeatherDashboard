## Objective  
This application allows the user to search for the current weather in a given city using JavaScript, JQuery and server-side APIs. The user will be able to view the temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and a five-day forecast for the city they search. The local storage will save the users searches so they can easily see the weather in saved cities.
